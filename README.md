# odin-recipes
The Odin Project - Project 1: Recipes

In this project, I will be practicing the HTML and Linux/Ubuntu knowledge that I have acquired by building a basic recipe website.
The webiste will consist of a main index page, which will have links to a few recipes.
I will be strictly utilizing Linux/Ubuntu's CLI (command line interface) to navigate the project, create files, and process git commands.
