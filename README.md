# odin-recipes
The Odin Project - Project 1: Recipes

In this project, I will be practicing the HTML and Linux/Ubuntu knowledge that I have acquired by building a basic recipe website.
The webiste will consist of a main index page, which will have links to a few recipes.
I will be strictly utilizing Linux/Ubuntu's CLI (command line interface) to navigate the project, create files, and process git commands.

Self Reflection:
I was able to complete this project and it was great practice!
Utilizing the Linux/Ubuntu's CLI (command line interface) to navigate the projects, create files, and process git commands was a breeze. I did have to look back at previous lectures to remind myself how to properly push the git repository to GitHub by using the command $git push origin main, but I believe that with some more practice I will remember this command by heart.
During this project I also discovered that my git commits could see improvement. I saw myself using words such as "added" and "updated" and feel this may not be best practice. I believe that it would be beneficial for me to understand conventional commits and to utilize them properly.
